# wa_color
python3 webscraper for AMU website


sends e-mails when the lesson plan or class cancellations change


---


# reason
* they change the plan so often that i thought it would be kinda convenient
* i have a sbc lying around


---


# features
* parses, detects and replaces any broken files (including config)
* sends a list of changes via e-mail in a human-readable format
* fetches the latest win10 chrome header from the [web](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/guides/the-latest-user-agent/) to camouflage itself
* loads content on-demand to slightly improve performance
* keeps JSON files in RAM to prevent unnecessary reads from disk
* has extensive logging and type hinting built-in
* auto-retries after network error
* can recreate the current and previous lesson plan as two HTML tables for easy comparison (via '--html' arg)

# setup

it is meant to run 24/7 on a headless linux server


### 1. clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ryouze/wa_color/
```


### 2. install deps

consider creating a venv first (put path to venv interpreter in systemd service instead of just python3): `python3 -m venv ./env --upgrade-deps && . bin/activate`

```bash
pip3 install beautifulsoup4 requests
```


### 3. run once

create files, fetch latest lesson plan and class cancellations

wait like 10-15s for it to finish (it will quit immediately after first run)

```bash
python3 main.py
```


### 4. edit settings

```bash
nano config/user.json
```


```
* loop_time_in_seconds - how much to wait in seconds between each loop (e.g., 900, 3600, 7200).
-> if set to 0 (default), then run only once, then quit.
* send_email - should an e-mail be sent on any detected change (e.g., true).
* group_pattern - regex pattern used to find your lesson group (e.g., "^1.*LMT").
* cancel - link to a list of class cancellations.
* plan - link to a list of lesson plans for all groups.
```


### 5. edit credentials

```bash
nano config/secret.json
```


```
* email_receivers - list of e-mail addresses to send message to (e.g., ["name.surname@mail.com"]).
* password - your e-mail password (e.g., "123").
* port - your outgoing e-mail port (e.g., 465).
* server - your outgoing e-mail server (e.g., "example.mail.com",).
* username - your e-mail address (e.g., "name.surname@example.mail.com").
```

requires an e-mail with smtp support (throwaway at interia works ig)


### 6. create systemd service

if you're not using systemd as your init system, then you can create a cron job (*nix) or a scheduled task (windows) instead

make sure to add a small startup delay (e.g., 40 seconds) to prevent it from using the fallback user agent - if it failed to fetch it on the first try, it will continue to use it till next restart

```bash
cd /etc/systemd/system
sudo nano wa_color.service
```

enter username and path to wa_color dir here

```bash
[Unit]
Description=wa_color (python3)

Wants=network.target
After=syslog.target network-online.target

[Service]
User=rin
WorkingDirectory=/home/rin/wa_color
ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 40
ExecStart=python3 /home/rin/wa_color/main.py
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=300
KillMode=mixed
TimeoutStartSec=120

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```


### 7. run systemd service


(I) autostart service on OS boot (e.g., after restart, power cut)
```bash
sudo systemctl enable wa_color.service
```

(II) start manually right now
```bash
sudo systemctl start wa_color.service
```

(III) check status
```bash
systemctl status wa_color.service
```

now it's gonna check the AMU website every X seconds (as specified in `./config/user.json`) and send e-mails


---


# problems

if it fails to run, check if you have:

* a) all the dependencies installed (requests, bs4)
* b) entered the correct paths in the systemd service (user, workdir, execstart)
* c) read/write permissions in the wa_color dir (chmod +rw)


---


# args

the program can take commandline arguments; this also enables DEBUG-level logging, in case something breaks


a) verbose - run normally but with verbose (DEBUG level) logging, useful for debugging


```bash
python3 main.py --verbose
```


b) html - create a html table of the current and previous lesson plan (for comparison), then save it in `./output.html`, then quit (no web scraper)


```bash
python3 main.py --html
```


c) mail - send debug e-mail to all recipients in `./config/secret.json`, then quit (no web scraper)


```bash
python3 main.py --mail
```


d) reset - re-create all directories from scratch (effectively equivalent to re-downloading the whole program and running it for the 1st time)


```bash
python3 main.py --reset
```
